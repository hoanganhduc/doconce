- consider qtip2.com/guides for tooltips when pointing at cite{} ref{} etc in html format, should also get up figures as in google attachment whhen pointing on a figure reference
- consider supporting remark slides: https://github.com/gnab/remark
- test latex2doconce og tabeller og idx
- strip header according to what is found in filestr

- consider filtering to Pweave :-)

Handle files with licence headers or other things that should not be copied:
- --rm-src-lines=10 in case full @@@CODE should skip licence header, doc string or similar
- better alternative: @@@CODEp for complete program - leads to *pro despite fromto

2. doconce diff_two_latest file, check git functionality first


=== Merging modules ===

Do examples and real-life projects first before
making general rules and tools!!

Do it first manually via sh or py script:
   Module includes other modules
   Module includes parts of other modules
   Module adds some new material (bridging)

doconce mergedir dirname source1 source2 source3 ...
essentially mkdir dirname and then rsync all sources (rsync_del) so
that source1/* etc are in dirname

sphinx: py script for making index file from a set of wrap_* files,
or make it manually? Look at fenics tutorial also and try it there
as an alternative to splitting a big file.

=== Nice tools ===

 * URL: "https://github.com/jterrace/sphinxtr" extension of sphinx for
   writing thesis with section numbers, citation numbers, etc.
   Could add parts of this to doconce: numsec and natbib, the rest
   is actually not of interest.
 * "pybtex": "http://pybtex.sourceforge.net/" can load bibtex into python,
   something a la publish.
